export const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    title: "How much does this cost?",
    content: "The cost of a solar panel system varies depending on factors like size, energy needs, and installation requirements. Our average Ground Mounted Solar system is $3.50 per watt before incentives."
  },
  {
    title: "How much time do I need to be involved in this?",
    content: "After an agreement has been reached, we will take care of everything else. Aside from unlocking the gate, in most cases your involvement is not required."
  },
  {
    title: "Do I need to submit any permits myself?",
    content: "No. Our team will handle all permitting."
  },
  {
    title: "How is The Ground Mount Company different from the other solar companies?",
    content: "We are the only company that specialize in ground mount installations. It’s our bread and butter. The other companies do rooftop solar, and then maybe a ground mount every now and then (and most likely subcontract it out)."
  },
  {
    title: "Will you also remove my roof-mounted panels?",
    content: "Yes. If you are getting a brand new roof and don’t want to drill holes in it a few days later, we can remove the panels from the roof and install them in a ground mounted structure."
  },
  {
    title: "If I don’t like it, can I request a refund?",
    content: "We guarantee the performance and production of the solar system. If the system doesn’t produce as agreed upon, we will do everything in our power to make it right."
  },
  {
    title: "Is this for people who want to install their ground-mounted systems themselves?",
    content: "No. We are a full service installation company. And since we are guaranteeing a certain level of system performance, we will perform all of the work. But if you are interested in a DIY approach, we can point you in the right direction."
  },
  {
    title: "How quickly will it take to complete?",
    content: "The permitting process depends on the city. But once everything has the green light, the actual installation will take 2 days  in most cases."
  },
  {
    title: "How long does a ground mounted system last?",
    content: "We used the highest quality galvanized steel that will survive 50+ years. And that number can increase with occasional maintenance."
  }
